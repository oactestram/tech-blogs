## Summary:

Web cache poisoning tricks your browser into displaying a fake website.  Attackers manipulate cached data, redirecting users to malicious sites. This can steal credentials or install malware. Prevention involves strong DNSSEC and HTTPS.

## What is Web Cache Poisoning?

Imagine your browser is a librarian, storing frequently accessed websites in its "cache" for faster loading. Web cache poisoning is like a sneaky librarian swapping a book with a fake copy.  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web caching systems (like DNS servers or CDNs) to inject malicious content into the cache. When you visit a website, your browser might fetch the poisoned data from its cache instead of the actual server, leading you to a harmful site.

This differs from a typical phishing attack, as you might be visiting a seemingly legitimate URL.  The attack lies hidden within the cached data itself.

## How it Works: A Simplified Example

Let's say you want to access `www.example.com`.  Normally, your browser queries a DNS server to get the IP address of `www.example.com`. Then, it connects to that IP address and receives the website's content.

In a cache poisoning attack, an attacker might:

1. **Compromise a DNS server:** They could manipulate the DNS server's records, so when your browser asks for `www.example.com`, it receives the IP address of a malicious site instead.  Your browser, trusting the DNS server, caches this wrong information.
2. **Exploit a vulnerability in a CDN (Content Delivery Network):**  CDNs store website content closer to users for faster access.  If a vulnerability exists, an attacker could inject malicious content into the CDN's cache for `www.example.com`.

Now, when you visit `www.example.com`, your browser gets the malicious content from its cache, believing it's legitimate.

## Use Cases (for Attackers, unfortunately):

* **Phishing:** Redirect users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
* **Malware distribution:** Deliver malicious scripts or downloads disguised as legitimate content.
* **Data theft:**  Trick users into revealing sensitive information through crafted forms.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overwhelm a legitimate website's resources by redirecting excessive traffic to a malicious copy.

## Case Study: A Hypothetical Scenario

Imagine a popular online banking website suffers a DNS cache poisoning attack.  Attackers compromise a local DNS server and inject a fake IP address for the bank's domain.  Customers who access the bank's website through that compromised DNS server are redirected to a meticulously crafted phishing site, mirroring the bank's login page.  Unsuspecting users enter their credentials, which are then intercepted by the attackers.

## Mitigating Web Cache Poisoning:

* **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions):**  Adds digital signatures to DNS records, making them tamper-proof.
* **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**  Encrypts communication between your browser and the website, making it harder to intercept or modify data in transit.
* **Regular software updates:** Keep your browser, operating system, and other software updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Cache control headers:**  Properly configured cache headers on websites can reduce the impact of cache poisoning.
* **Using a reputable DNS provider:** Choose a DNS provider with a strong security track record.


Web cache poisoning highlights the importance of securing all layers of the internet infrastructure, from the DNS servers to the end-user's browser.  Being aware of this attack vector is the first step in protecting yourself and your data.
